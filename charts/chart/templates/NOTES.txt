Thank you for installing the Firefly On-Prem Redactor (version: {{ .Chart.AppVersion }}).
The redactor is implemented as a Kubernetes CronJob that is executed
based on your chosen schedule (or every 2 hours by default), and
crawls for terraform state files from a remote source
(Terraform Cloud, Google Cloud Storage, Amazon S3, Hashicorp Consul),
redacts all sensitive information from the state files.
Finally, the redactor saves the redacted state files in a mirror Amazon S3 Bucket.
